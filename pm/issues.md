## Field Type Settings

Most field types are missing important settings. 

## No support for choices list field settings

Multiple field types require choices list.

## Properties should just be fields

Maybe it's pointless to have the terminology properties when we are just making fields?

## No equivalent to ACF options pages

## No support for register taxonomy

## No support for creating Gutenberg blocks

## No clone field type

## No tab field type

## No accordion field type

## No validation on the fields

## No permissions handling on the API routes

## No front end forms support
